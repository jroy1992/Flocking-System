This is an implementation of flocking behaviors to perform procedural painting.
The window opens with all the boids positioned in the proximity of the origin. The behaviors start with the keyPress event.
 #Key controls for implementing behaviors:
‘s’ or ‘S’ = separation

‘a’ or ‘A’ = alignment

‘c’ or ‘C’ = cohesion

‘f’ or ‘F’ = flocking

‘p’ or ‘P’ = path following

‘l’ or ‘L’ = flow field following ranaom

'm' or 'M' = flow field following cos sin wave

‘q’ = clear screen // can be used to clear screen after each behavior to provide fresh space for the new one.
